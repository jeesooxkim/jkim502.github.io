			<h3 class="center">CAREER INTERESTS_</h3>
			<p class="p1">I am interested in entering the tech industry as a software engineer, with hopes of building efficient and convenient programs which enhance people's quality of life, whether that be for recreational purposes, time-saving, or for creating better systems to help people in need. My passion of art an design also beings me to emphasize aesthetically pleasing interfaces, and with diverse experiences in product design, graphic design, and marketing through student organizations, I have developed interest in UX/UI design as well. I'm still investigating my options, for sure!</p>

				<h5 class="center">MUSIC</h5>
				<p class="p1">I took violin lessons for 7 years, and continued to play for longer. Although I largely stopped playing midway through high school, I've kept my musical side active in other ways!</p>
				<p class="p1">I taught myself the french horn and the mellophone for marching/concert band in high school, and switch off between bouts of learning guitar and piano on my own. At Hopkins, I also performed in the Korean-interest a cappella group, Humming Jay, for a year. Unfortunately I had to stop because of time committment reasons, but I'm always finding opportunities to fit more music into my daily life.</p>

				<img src="assets/images/travel.png" class="travel extramarginbottom"/>
				<h5 class="center">TRAVELING</h5>
				<p class="p1">Traveling is the best way to give myself the fresh air I need! I've been to France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, and Korea, on various occassions. Also, within the US, I've traveled to many states, particularly centered around national parks. Hopefully I'll get the opportunity to travel to more areas in Europe, especially the northern regions.</p>

				<h5 class="center">DESIGN</h5>
				<p class="p1">I have learned an assortment of arts whenever I could. Some examples include calligraphy, crocheting, knotting, and acryllics. Since entering college, I have really started to pick up graphic design using Adobe Illustrator, and have been doing a lot of designing for groups that I'm involved with.</p>
