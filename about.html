					<h3 class="center">WELCOME!</h3>
					<p>Hello, thanks for stopping by at my website. I'm a sophomore studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, located in Balimore, MD. I'm originally from the small suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, but also spent some time of my life in Gainesville, Florida, and Seoul, South Korea.</p>

					<h3 class="center">RESEARCH INTERESTS</h3>
					<p>I'm a person with a wide range of interests, in both science and the arts. Although I am still exploring to find my exact focus area, my research interests are in using computational and robotic approaches to create better treatments for patients who suffer from currently incurable diseases.</p>
					<p>Simultaneously, I have diverse experiences in product design and marketing as well as graphic design and sketching. Combining these two polar interests, the intersection of creativity and medical research points me in the wonderful direction of biomedical engineering. Keeping my hands constantly busy by tinkering with projects, whether that be a physically complex product requiring meticulousness, or digitally complex project that requires logical thinking and trial and error, is what I love to do the most.</p>
					<br>

				<div>
					<h3 class="center">FUTURE PLANS</h3>
					<p>I am planning to delve into industry after graduation in May of 2019. I do, however, plan to pursue graduate school and earn a PhD degree at some point in my career.</p>

				<h3 class="center">THINGS THAT MAKE ME A REAL PERSON</h3>
				<div class="threecolumn">
					<h5 class="center">TRAVELING</h5>
					<p>I love traveling. I've been to France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, and Korea, on various occassions. Also, within the US, I've traveled to many states, mainly centering upon national parks. My all time favorite two national parks are Yellowstone and Yosemite, without a doubt. I hope to travel more through Europe, especially the northern regions where I have yet to visit. Another place on the top of my list is Alaska, to see the famed northern lights.</p>

					<h5 class="center">MUSIC</h5>
					<p>Ever since I learned to play the violin as a child, music has been a constant in my life. I took lessons for violin for 7 years, and continued to play for longer. Although I largely stopped playing midway through high school, I've picked up other muscial hobbies along the way.</p>
					<p>I self-taught myself the french horn and the mellophone for marching/concert band in high school, and am learning guitar and piano on my own in my free time. At Hopkins, I embraced my love for singing by joining and performing in the Korean-interest a cappella group, Humming Jay--which, of course means that karaoke is always a good idea in my book. I'm always finding opportunities to fit more music opportunities into my life!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="threecolumn">
					<img src="assets/images/paintbrush.png" class="paintbrush"/>
					<h5 class="center">ART + DESIGN</h5>
					<p>I have learned an assortment of random crafts whenever I could. Some examples include calligraphy, crocheting, knotting, and acryllics. So many things to learn, and so little time!</p>
