			<h3>Android Developer/iOS Manager at Speech Banana JHU</h3>
			<p>Speech Banana is an exercise-based application designed to aid deaf individuals who have received a cochlear implant, hence have lingering impairments in listening, in improving their listening/communications skills and quality of life.</p>
			<p>I am the developer of the Android version of the app while also in charge of maintaining the iOS version. In the future we plan to implement gaming components to the chapter exercises to create an engaging user interface. We are also seeking to increase our reach within the deaf community by working on a British English version and a Korean version of the application.</p>

			<h3>Research in Computational Biology at Cahan Lab (Institute of Cellular Engineering and Institute of Computational Medicine)</h3>
			<p>Cahan Lab focuses on accurate and efficient analysis of RNA-seq data through developing a cloud-based platform (written in R language) called CellNet in order to improve the accuracy of stem cell differentiation with respect to its target cells.</p>
			<p>My current project focuses on human RNA-seq data collection from mass online databases, and improving the efficiency of the CellNet system in order for quicker processing and analysis of existing human RNA-seq accessions.</p>
